20steps Alexa Backend
=====================

This is the backend of the "20steps" Alexa skill - the skill aims to support developers and system administrators. 

Furthermore this project is a demonstration of the capabilities of the RAD platform Bricks by 20steps.

Current capabilitites:
* Possiblity to ask UptimeRobot.com for system status
* Alexa Account linking for pre-registered users
* Some easter egg

TODO:
* User management and Alexa account linking so users can enter their API key for UptimeRobot.com at https://alexa.20steps.de (wip)
* Some more capabilities that help developers and system administrators (any ideas welcome e.g. integration of additional services)
* Prepare for Alexa push messages
* Localization for english language (in addition to german language)
* Automated tests

Hints for fellow readers:
* The business logic resides in the https://github.com/20steps/alexa/tree/master/src/Bricks/Custom/Twentysteps/AlexaBrick/AlexaBundle/Modules directory
