== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to sign-up for a PushAlert account to use this plugin? =
Yes, you can sign-up for a free account at PushAlert and you will get the REST API key and WebsiteID from the Integrate section. Just add those to the plugin settings and you are all set.

= It doesn't seem to work, I can't see any opt-in prompt or javascript code. =
If you are using W3 Total Cache, SuperCache or any other cache plugin, you would need to first purge the cache once after the plugin has been configured. CloudFlare or any other CDN must also be purged once for the plugin to work.

= Can PushAlert work on HTTP websites? =
Yes, it works with both http and https websites. Push Notifications require an SSL connection, therefore, for HTTP websites we provide a branded HTTPS subdomain similar to https://yourdomain.pushalert.co.

= What will happen after I cross 3000 subscribers limit in my free account? =
Once you reach 3000 subscribers, you won't be able to send any notifications but your website visitors will still be able to subscribe to push notifications. You would have to upgrade to a <a href="https://pushalert.co/pricing">paid plan</a> to send notifications.
