== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Custom post type are supported? =

Yes! Enable them on the plugin settings screen.

= Can I display my note on the front-end? =

Yes. Use the `[spnote]` shortcode. You can also pass optional parameter with post ID: `[spnote id="123"]` to display note from other post. By default it's grabbing current post.

= Can I disable display of admin column? =

Yes, by a simple filter.

Use:
`add_filter( 'spn/columns-display', '__return_false' );`
To disable SPN column for all post types

Or use
`add_filter( 'spn/columns-display/POST_TYPE_SLUG', '__return_false' );`
To disable SPN column only for specific post type
